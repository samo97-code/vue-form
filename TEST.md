# Vue Test

You have a main component (App.vue) and two subcomponents taken directly for the main site.

You may need to add more components to the components directory - that is your choice.

Everything you need for the project is already installed - vuelidate and tailwind. If you feel you need to install something else you are free to do so.

## Wireframe

A screenshot of the wireframe is in the main directory as is an input style. I'm sorry but at the moment I can't invite you to the main figma file. There is also a screenshot with measurements in rems.

## The password component  validations

Error Message: "Password too short. Must be at least 8 characters."
No Upper Case:

Error Message: "Include at least one upper-case letter for a stronger password."
No Lower Case:

Error Message: "Include at least one lower-case letter for a stronger password."
No Numbers:

Error Message: "Include at least one number for a stronger password."
No Special Characters:

Error Message: "Include at least one special character (e.g., !, @, #, $) for a stronger password."

Passwords Don't Match:
Error Message: "Passwords do not match. Please re-enter."

Common Password:
Error Message: "Password is too common. Please choose a unique password."

## Form submission

Please use axios, POST, to /form-submission. You are NOT expected to produce the endpoint only fire the post.

## Time

Although time is a factor, quality is definitely more important. 

This is not a race.

There are 5 hours to finish the task; however, if you need more time you can request it, but I will have to review your code before approving the extra time.

It would be good to have the submission by monday.
